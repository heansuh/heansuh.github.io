Here I am writing my first post in this blog.

I've never thought that I'll become a developer or anywhere near. However, as I start working for [Vattenfall](https://www.vattenfall.de) for Fundamental Analysis, I am starting learn more about data engineering - its principles, concepts and the tools used.

I also made a favicon through ChatGPT (and somehow image upload was not working on Hexo, and I found the [solution](https://chrismroberts.com/2020/01/06/using-markdown-in-hexo-to-add-images/)):

The purpose of this blog is like a knowledge hub - anything that I did not know about Python code, data engineering, data science and whichever topics, will be showcased here. I am also planning to put up my portfolio projects through GitHub repositories.

At the end of the day, I'll need to graduate from my university. I hope that this journey is fulfilling at the end such that I can produce some nice works, for me to be able to show some actual, workable projects.

A promise to myself was to work on the "coding" post everyday. Even if it's not a meaningful one, I think it's okay - it's more about the documentation and filling my missing gaps to enhance my code proficiency.

Let's see where it takes!
